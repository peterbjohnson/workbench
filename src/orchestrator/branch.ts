   * definition will not until a person merges it. So the branch is cut from the
   * base, as every branch is, and then the offered work is merged in: the commit
   * this ticket needs is the base with all of its dependencies on it, and nowhere
   * else in the world is there one. Without this the wait is honoured in name and
   * defeated in fact — the ticket starts at the right time, on the wrong code.
   *
   * Only where the branch is cut, so a ticket pays for this once. The standing
   * checks are not run: they judge a ticket's own work against a base that moved,
   * and there is no work here yet.
   *
   * A conflict blocks the ticket — `perform` turns the throw into `blocked`, and
   * this is reached before `stage_started`, so two dependencies that will not sit in
   * one tree stop it at the cheapest moment there is. Whatever merged before the
   * conflict is recorded first: it is on the branch, and the branch's record has to
   * say what the branch is.
