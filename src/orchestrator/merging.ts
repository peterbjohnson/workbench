 * - `merge`: run implement over the merge, and merge what it landed. A merge the

   * The manager said merge it, here rather than on the code host.

   * The base goes in first, and a clash gets the one resolution attempt every other
   * branch meeting its base gets: the same run, with the same brief, and the same
   * abort-and-block when it does not land. What that costs is one run per Accept,
   * held in the gate and said out loud on the ticket — against the runs it replaces,
   * which were one per *landing* for every other offered branch, said nowhere.
   *
   * When nothing lands, nothing is merged, the branch is put back and the ticket
   * parks with the files named. That is the one moment the answer matters most —
   * the alternative is finding out from the host that the merge was refused, which
   * says less and leaves it half-done.
   *
   * The verdict is recorded here rather than left for the next poll to read off
   * the host: the ticket leaves `awaiting_verdict` at once, so a second tick
   * cannot arrive and merge what has already been merged.
   *
   * All of it behind the merge gate, the pass over the other branches included: see
   * `runMerge` for what two of those at once does.
